## Acceptance criteria (every criterion must be checked and listed in coverage_checked as its id)
- CRITERION c1: For every observation verify exact primary value, model/checkpoint and explicitly published effort/harness, benchmark version, units, source date, measured/self_reported/derived basis and every derivation. A prior accepted subject identity is fixed; no alias inference is permitted. Verify protocol and locator against current primary evidence. Unknown configurations cannot create comparison_key values.

## Candidate rows (7 rows; the frozen artifact file content is JSON.stringify of these rows)
Owner-computed canonical SHA-256 per row (you cannot recompute hashes; use these to bind rows):

BrokenArXiv is a benchmark of plausible but false proof statements extracted from recent arXiv papers. Models are rewarded for refusing to prove the statement and for explicitly recognizing when it is false as written.

The Kangaroo competition is a multiple-choice math competition with 6 levels, each corresponding to two grade levels in school (e.g., level 1-2 is for grades 1 and 2). Each level consists of 24-30 problems that test mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills, often requiring visual interpretation of diagrams or patterns.

The Kangaroo competition is a multiple-choice math competition with 6 levels, each corresponding to two grade levels in school (e.g., level 1-2 is for grades 1 and 2). Each level consists of 24-30 problems that test mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills, often requiring visual interpretation of diagrams or patterns.

The Miklós Schweitzer Competition is an annual international mathematics competition for university students, held in Hungary. It is named after Miklós Schweitzer, a Hungarian mathematician known for his contributions to functional analysis and operator theory. Students get 10 days to solve the 10 proof-based problems, and can use any resources they like except for help from other people. As such, it is one of the most challenging and unique mathematics competitions in the world.

              
                
The model was officially submitted and evaluated by the competition organizers. Models were executed without tool access.

The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is a prestigious annual mathematics competition for undergraduate students in the United States and Canada. It consists of 12 challenging proof-based problems, divided into two sessions of 6 problems each. The competition is known for its difficulty and is considered one of the most challenging undergraduate math competitions in the world.

              
                
Grading was performed by the official Putnam grading committee.

The USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) is a prestigious high school mathematics competition in the United States. It is the final round of the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) series and serves as a qualifier for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). The USAMO consists of six challenging proof-based problems.

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems also require programming skills to arrive at solutions efficiently. Each week, a new problem gets released

              
                
Below each problem ID we show the official Difficulty Rating, ranging from 5% (easiest) to 100% (hardest). For recent problems such as these, ratings may still change.

We use a rule-based parser to extract final answers and compare them to the ground truth, using LaTeX parsing with Sympy to handle mathematical expressions. While this parser performed well for almost all problems, the diversity of mathematical outputs in ArXivMath led to false negatives in approximately 1% of model responses. To address this, we implemented a fallback LLM judge using Gemini-3-Flash for all incorrect or unparsable responses. Any answer deemed correct by the LLM judge was then manually verified to prevent false positives.

Dynamic: Each month, we will release a new version containing problems drawn from the most recent arXiv submissions. Uncontaminated: By sourcing questions from newly published papers, we minimize the risk of contamination from model training data.
