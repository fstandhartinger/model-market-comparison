## Acceptance criteria (every criterion must be checked and listed in coverage_checked as its id)
- CRITERION c1: Check the registry version, benchmark identity, metric, units and description against the actual current primary protocol. If the excerpt cannot establish continuity, report missing evidence. A changed task set, harness, judges, configuration or release version cannot silently reuse the existing identity. When the packet additionally carries this run's own generated summary of the values the maintainer serves today for this board's source field — how many finite values there are and the lowest and the highest — that summary is admissible for exactly one judgement: whether the row's `unit` and `range` describe the scale the board is actually served on. A protocol page states the scoring rule and need never state that scale, so a row whose `unit` and `range` agree with the served values is correct on this point even when the protocol text says nothing about it, and a row that disagrees with them is a mismatch. Judge only the bounds the row actually states: a `range` bound written as `null` is the row declining to claim one, and an unbounded bound is never contradicted by any served value, however large or small or negative. That summary is this run's own read of the captured payload, not maintainer text: it settles nothing about what the metric means, how it is computed, or which task set, harness, judges or version produced it.
- CRITERION c2: Check the lifecycle fields (status, version_status, superseded_by) against the same protocol text. `status` records whether the maintainer still reports results for this board: `"active"` means it still publishes them; `"retained"` means the protocol shows the board retired, removed, or replaced going forward, and we keep the values already collected without claiming they are current. `superseded_by` holds **our registry id for the successor board**, not a quotation: check that the protocol names that successor, and do not expect this board's protocol passage to establish the successor's version — that version is settled by the successor's own registry entry and its own evidence. `version_status` says what kind of identifier the row's `version` is, and it is our word, not the maintainer's: `"published"` means the maintainer publishes a release identifier for this board and the `version` copies it; `"snapshot"` means the maintainer publishes no release identifier at all, so the `version` is the dated identity `snapshot-<date>` we wrote to freeze the methodology observed that day; `"retained"` means a published identifier we deliberately no longer refresh from the current page. A protocol page that publishes no release identifier for this board is what supports `"snapshot"`, and `"snapshot"` is a mismatch only when the page does publish one. Never report missing evidence because the protocol text does not contain the words `snapshot`, `published` or `retained`, and never because it does not name a `snapshot-<date>` version: no maintainer writes our vocabulary or our dates, and what settles this field is whether the page publishes a release identifier for this board at all. `superseded_by: null` is, in the same way, the row declining to name a successor: a page that names no successor never contradicts it, and it is a mismatch only when the protocol names a successor board. Read status and supersession independently: a board can be superseded in one index and still be reported in another, and a supersession note alone is not a retirement. Report a mismatch when the protocol text contradicts one of these fields, and missing evidence when the excerpt cannot settle it. These fields are the row's only statement about whether the board is still live; judge them, and judge nothing else as such a statement. When the packet additionally carries this run's own generated summary of how many model rows' values for this board's source field were added or changed in today's captured maintainer payload compared with the previously published snapshot, a nonzero count of added or changed values is affirmative evidence for `status: "active"` for this board only — a maintainer serving new or changed values is still reporting them; that summary settles nothing about the methodology, task set, harness, judges or version, and it can never establish `"retained"`.

The Kangaroo competition is a multiple-choice math competition with 6 levels, each corresponding to two grade levels in school (e.g., level 1-2 is for grades 1 and 2). Each level consists of 24-30 problems that test mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills, often requiring visual interpretation of diagrams or patterns.

The Miklós Schweitzer Competition is an annual international mathematics competition for university students, held in Hungary. It is named after Miklós Schweitzer, a Hungarian mathematician known for his contributions to functional analysis and operator theory. Students get 10 days to solve the 10 proof-based problems, and can use any resources they like except for help from other people. As such, it is one of the most challenging and unique mathematics competitions in the world.

              
                
The model was officially submitted and evaluated by the competition organizers. Models were executed without tool access.

We use a rule-based parser to extract final answers and compare them to the ground truth, using LaTeX parsing with Sympy to handle mathematical expressions. While this parser performed well for almost all problems, the diversity of mathematical outputs in ArXivMath led to false negatives in approximately 1% of model responses. To address this, we implemented a fallback LLM judge using Gemini-3-Flash for all incorrect or unparsable responses. Any answer deemed correct by the LLM judge was then manually verified to prevent false positives.

Dynamic: Each month, we will release a new version containing problems drawn from the most recent arXiv submissions. Uncontaminated: By sourcing questions from newly published papers, we minimize the risk of contamination from model training data.

To mitigate this risk, we restrict each benchmark version to papers published within the last month.

The strongest model evaluated so far, GPT-5.2, achieves 60% accuracy, indicating impressive performance while leaving significant room for improvement.

Generated activity summary for the maintainer's source field "accuracy". This run compared today's captured MathArena (SRI Lab, ETH Zurich; INSAIT)'s published results payload for this board (sha256 e86f7d42c9a94cca182764a199ad1d369217f3fd1fcc5d6d242172e33ecf0ec6, retrieved 2026-10-09T05:22:29.615225+00:00) with the previously published snapshot and found 1 model row(s) whose "accuracy" value differs today: 1 value(s) on model rows that had none before, 0 changed value(s), 0 value(s) the board no longer publishes. A maintainer adding or changing the values it serves for this field is still running and reporting this board.

```
Generated value-scale summary for the maintainer's source field "accuracy". This run read every finite value the maintainer serves for that field in today's captured MathArena (SRI Lab, ETH Zurich; INSAIT)'s published results payload for this board (sha256 e86f7d42c9a94cca182764a199ad1d369217f3fd1fcc5d6d242172e33ecf0ec6, retrieved 2026-10-09T05:22:29.615225+00:00) and found 13 value(s), the lowest 38.6 and the highest 96.49. These are the numbers exactly as the maintainer serves them, before anything Benchmark Heaven does with them, so they show the scale this board is published on and nothing else: they cannot establish what the metric means, how it is computed, or which task set, harness, judges or version produced it.
