## Acceptance criteria (every criterion must be checked and listed in coverage_checked as its id)
- CRITERION c1: For every observation verify exact primary value, model/checkpoint and explicitly published effort/harness, benchmark version, units, source date, measured/self_reported/derived basis and every derivation. A prior accepted subject identity is fixed; no alias inference is permitted. Verify protocol and locator against current primary evidence. Unknown configurations cannot create comparison_key values.

## Candidate rows (10 rows; the frozen artifact file content is JSON.stringify of these rows)
Owner-computed canonical SHA-256 per row (you cannot recompute hashes; use these to bind rows):

Repetition Metric

          
The  Repetition  column measures the tendency of a model to repeat words and phrases in the outputs generated for this benchmark. It sums the frequencies of the top most common words, bigrams and trigrams that appear in the text. Higher values indicate more repetitive output.


          
Slop Score

          
The  Slop  column measures the frequency of words/phrases typically overused by LLMs ("GPT-isms"). The value is calculated by matching the text against a master slop list derived from over-represented words & phrases in outputs from many models.

```
Generated activity summary for the maintainer's source field "elo_score". This run compared today's captured EQ-bench (Sam Paech)'s published results payload for this board (sha256 722ddb132e8d3a5e5c39b8d445f8475f3f7e24893a007260c6f3e3cce5c1ee18, retrieved 2026-10-11T05:27:23.837804+00:00) with the previously published snapshot and found 10 model row(s) whose "elo_score" value differs today: 0 value(s) on model rows that had none before, 10 changed value(s), 0 value(s) the board no longer publishes. A maintainer adding or changing the values it serves for this field is still running and reporting this board.

```
Generated value-scale summary for the maintainer's source field "elo_score". This run read every finite value the maintainer serves for that field in today's captured EQ-bench (Sam Paech)'s published results payload for this board (sha256 722ddb132e8d3a5e5c39b8d445f8475f3f7e24893a007260c6f3e3cce5c1ee18, retrieved 2026-10-11T05:27:23.837804+00:00) and found 140 value(s), the lowest 200 and the highest 2173.3. These are the numbers exactly as the maintainer serves them, before anything Benchmark Heaven does with them, so they show the scale this board is published on and nothing else: they cannot establish what the metric means, how it is computed, or which task set, harness, judges or version produced it.
