## Acceptance criteria (every criterion must be checked and listed in coverage_checked as its id)
- CRITERION c1: Check the registry version, benchmark identity, metric, units and description against the actual current primary protocol. If the excerpt cannot establish continuity, report missing evidence. A changed task set, harness, judges, configuration or release version cannot silently reuse the existing identity.
- CRITERION c2: Check the lifecycle fields (status, version_status, superseded_by) against the same protocol text. `status` records whether the maintainer still reports results for this board: `"active"` means it still publishes them; `"retained"` means the protocol shows the board retired, removed, or replaced going forward, and we keep the values already collected without claiming they are current. `superseded_by` holds **our registry id for the successor board**, not a quotation: check that the protocol names that successor, and do not expect this board's protocol passage to establish the successor's version — that version is settled by the successor's own registry entry and its own evidence. Read status and supersession independently: a board can be superseded in one index and still be reported in another, and a supersession note alone is not a retirement. Report a mismatch when the protocol text contradicts one of these fields, and missing evidence when the excerpt cannot settle it. These fields are the row's only statement about whether the board is still live; judge them, and judge nothing else as such a statement. When the packet additionally carries this run's own generated summary of how many model rows' values for this board's source field were added or changed in today's captured maintainer payload compared with the previously published snapshot, a nonzero count of added or changed values is affirmative evidence for `status: "active"` for this board only — a maintainer serving new or changed values is still reporting them; that summary settles nothing about the methodology, task set, harness, judges or version, and it can never establish `"retained"`.

Motivation


As AI capabilities rapidly advance, understanding their potential to transform economic sectors has become critical for organizations making deployment decisions. Unlike existing aggregated metrics that treat all capabilities equally, the Vals Index is designed to reflect the potential impact of AI models on the U.S. economy. We accomplish this by computing a weighted average of model performance across key sectors, where each sector’s weight is proportional to its share of U.S. GDP.


Vals AI has developed a comprehensive suite of benchmarks measuring AI models’ ability to perform real-world tasks across finance, coding, and legal work — benchmarks that no other party has full access to. The Vals Index aggregates five private and two public benchmarks to provide high signal into the real-world tradeoffs between capability, latency, and cost of deploying AI systems.

Key Takeaways


AI models are advancing rapidly in their ability to handle complex, real-world tasks across critical economic sectors. The results demonstrate that frontier models are becoming increasingly capable at automating work in finance, coding, and legal services — domains that collectively represent a substantial portion of economic activity.


Claude Opus 5.5
 leads the Vals Index at 69.69% — and leads Terminal-Bench — ahead of 
Claude Fable 5.1
 at 68.83%, 
Claude Opus 5
 at 67.21%, 
GPT-6 Astra
 at 66.61% — which takes the top spot on Code Migration — and 
Claude Fable 5
 at 66.04%. 
Muse Spark 1.3 Max
 follows in sixth at 64.53%, ahead of 
GPT-5.6 Sol
 at 63.71%. 
GPT-5.6 Luna
 reaches 59.88% at $0.77 per test, 6.2 points behind fifth-place Fable 5 at less than a twentieth of its cost.




Methodology


Benchmark Selection, Economic Weighting, and Formula


The Vals Index aggregates performance across three sectors — Finance, Coding, and Legal — each weighted in proportion to its share of U.S. GDP, using Bureau of Economic Analysis value-added-by-industry data (as published on FRED). While this represents a vast oversimplification of how AI might impact the economy, it provides a useful proxy for measuring the potential economic significance of model capabilities:


Finance: Finance & Insurance, ~8.0% of U.S. GDP




Finance Agent v2
: Multi-step financial reasoning tasks


Excel Modeling Benchmark
: Building and editing financial models in spreadsheets




Coding: Information sector (the closest GDP proxy for software work), ~5.6% of U.S. GDP




Terminal-Bench 2.1
: Command-line interface problem solving


Vibe Code Bench
: End-to-end app-building tasks


Code Migration
: Porting projects to another language, including COBOL modernization




Legal: Legal services, ~1.2% of U.S. GDP




Legal Research Bench
: Case and statute research with citation-backed answers


HLAB
: Harvey’s Legal Agent Benchmark, long-horizon legal work product creation




Each sector is the average of its benchmarks, and the sectors are combined with the following formula:


Finance 
=
 AVG
(FinanceAgentV2, EMB)


Coding 
=
 AVG
(TBench, VibeCodeBench, CodeMigration)


Legal 
=
 AVG
(LegalResearch, HLAB)


Vals_Index 
=
 (
8.0
 *
 Finance 
+
 5.6
 *
 Coding 
+
 1.2
 *
 Legal) 
/
 14.8




Component Scores


Each benchmark column on the index is that benchmark’s own published standalone score — the same number, under the same methodology. The exception is Code Migration: there, the index scores a fixed subset of the published run: 50 of the 120 CLI migration tasks, plus all 10 COBOL tasks, weighted 75% CLI and 25% COBOL to match the standalone benchmark’s balance. This subset was chosen by Monte Carlo search, scored against the full 120-task leaderboard. The chosen subset reproduces the full 120-task result to Spearman 0.99 and 0.8 points of mean absolute accuracy error, with no model moving more than three ranks; on models held out of the selection, mean absolute error is 1.1 points.




Updates


8/13/2026


Released Vals Index v2:




Added 
EMB
 in place of CorpFin.
 A private benchmark for building complex financial models in Excel.


Added 
Code Migration
 to the coding bucket.
 A private benchmark involving porting projects to a set of four languages, including COBOL modernization.


Added 
Legal Research Bench
 to the returning Legal sector.
 A private benchmark involving answering legal questions grounded in case law.


Added 
HLAB
 to the returning Legal sector.
 Harvey’s Legal Agent Benchmark, long-horizon legal work product creation.


Removed SWE-Bench Verified from the coding bucket.
 SWE-Bench has become saturated. Coding now averages Terminal-Bench 2.1, Vibe Code Bench, and Code Migration equally.




5/27/2026




Updated the coding bucket to Terminal-Bench 2.1.
 The Vals Index now evaluates coding performance with Terminal-Bench 2.1 while keeping the same 0.25 coding weight.




5/13/2026




Swapped Finance Agent to Finance Agent v2.
 Finance now uses the Finance Agent v2 index subset, averaging three runs per model.




5/4/2026




Added Vibe Code Bench to the coding bucket.
 Coding is now a weighted average of three benchmarks (SWE-Bench Verified 0.25, Terminal-Bench 2.0 0.25, Vibe Code Bench 0.5), giving end-to-end app-building tasks half of the coding signal. VCB is evaluated on a 22-task subset selected for coverage across UI, data, and workflow patterns.


Removed the Law sector (CaseLaw).
 The CaseLaw benchmark had become saturated, and was no longer providing useful differentiation between models. Consequently, it was removed from the index. The denominator was rebalanced from 3.7 → 3.4 to reflect the dropped 0.3 law weight, and the Industry Average chart no longer displays a Law column.
