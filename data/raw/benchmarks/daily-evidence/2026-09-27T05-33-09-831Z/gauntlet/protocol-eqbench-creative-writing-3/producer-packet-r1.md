## Acceptance criteria (every criterion must be checked and listed in coverage_checked as its id)
- CRITERION c1: Check the registry version, benchmark identity, metric, units and description against the actual current primary protocol. If the excerpt cannot establish continuity, report missing evidence. A changed task set, harness, judges, configuration or release version cannot silently reuse the existing identity.
- CRITERION c2: Check the lifecycle fields (status, version_status, superseded_by) against the same protocol text. `status` records whether the maintainer still reports results for this board: `"active"` means it still publishes them; `"retained"` means the protocol shows the board retired, removed, or replaced going forward, and we keep the values already collected without claiming they are current. `superseded_by` holds **our registry id for the successor board**, not a quotation: check that the protocol names that successor, and do not expect this board's protocol passage to establish the successor's version — that version is settled by the successor's own registry entry and its own evidence. Read status and supersession independently: a board can be superseded in one index and still be reported in another, and a supersession note alone is not a retirement. Report a mismatch when the protocol text contradicts one of these fields, and missing evidence when the excerpt cannot settle it. These fields are the row's only statement about whether the board is still live; judge them, and judge nothing else as such a statement. When the packet additionally carries this run's own generated summary of how many model rows' values for this board's source field were added or changed in today's captured maintainer payload compared with the previously published snapshot, a nonzero count of added or changed values is affirmative evidence for `status: "active"` for this board only — a maintainer serving new or changed values is still reporting them; that summary settles nothing about the methodology, task set, harness, judges or version, and it can never establish `"retained"`.

Repetition Metric

          
The 
Repetition
 column measures the tendency of a model to repeat words and phrases in the outputs generated for this benchmark. It sums the frequencies of the top most common words, bigrams and trigrams that appear in the text. Higher values indicate more repetitive output.


          
Slop Score

          
The 
Slop
 column measures the frequency of words/phrases typically overused by LLMs ("GPT-isms"). The value is calculated by matching the text against a master slop list derived from over-represented words & phrases in outputs from many models.
