## Acceptance criteria (every criterion must be checked and listed in coverage_checked as its id)
- CRITERION c1: For every observation verify exact primary value, model/checkpoint and explicitly published effort/harness, benchmark version, units, source date, measured/self_reported/derived basis and every derivation. A prior accepted subject identity is fixed; no alias inference is permitted. Verify protocol and locator against current primary evidence. Unknown configurations cannot create comparison_key values.

## Candidate rows (13 rows; the frozen artifact file content is JSON.stringify of these rows)
Owner-computed canonical SHA-256 per row (you cannot recompute hashes; use these to bind rows):

Repetition Metric

          
The 
Repetition
 column measures the tendency of a model to repeat words and phrases in the outputs generated for this benchmark. It sums the frequencies of the top most common words, bigrams and trigrams that appear in the text. Higher values indicate more repetitive output.


          
Slop Score

          
The 
Slop
 column measures the frequency of words/phrases typically overused by LLMs ("GPT-isms"). The value is calculated by matching the text against a master slop list derived from over-represented words & phrases in outputs from many models.
