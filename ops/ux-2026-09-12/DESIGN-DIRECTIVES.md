# DESIGN DIRECTIVES — Benchmark Heaven (design authority: Claude Fable 5.1)

**Pass 16: 2026-09-15 ~04:30 UTC**, the "what changed since pass 15" pass (Florian: Fable sparingly), against live
revision `3dac13e` (https://benchmarkheaven.com). Evidence: `/opt/benchmarkheaven/state/ux-evidence/fable-20260915-pass16/`
— 60 shots + `metrics.json` (`/benchmarks` after F-83, the One-benchmark BullshitBench board, the Advanced "Better
than a model" panel with the retained Opus 4.7 reference, the model page with speed/context, Simple, Guided,
Benchmaxxing; 1440/390 × light/dark). Script: `bin/shoot-fable-pass16.mjs`. Pass-16 fixes live-checked in `after/`.
Earlier passes: `…/fable-20260915-pass15/` … `…/fable-20260913/`.

**The bar (Florian):** minimalistic and simple, very expressive, not overloaded, key messages
first, graphical with many charts.

**How to use this file.** Directives are numbered `F-nn`, ordered by value. Each has *Where*
(files), *What* (implementable spec), *Accept* (what the reviewer checks live). Implementers
take the top open directive, ship it, move its row to the *Done log* at the bottom with the
commit hash and evidence path. Do not re-interpret a directive; if it cannot be done as
written, leave it open and write why under it. Fable decides, others implement.

**Delegation hint.** `[mechanical]` directives are safe for `bin/delegate.sh --kimi` (clear
spec, no numbers to invent) with a 20-minute cap; `[judgment]` ones need Claude Opus 5 or Codex
Luna. Every delegated diff is reviewed before it lands. Record from passes 8, 11, 12 and iterations
17/50: Kimi K3 stalls on one-file TSX edits (reads, no diff); surgical TSX changes are faster done by
the reviewing engine directly.

## Verdict on the live site — pass 16 (2026-09-15), what changed since pass 15

**The Benchmarks page is now at the bar: the table is the first thing on the screen, the bars are bands, and
every page shot in this pass is clean at both widths and both themes — no overflow, no page errors.** What
changed and holds: F-83 landed as specified (at 1440 the first value sits at y = 516, at 390 the table header
at y = 522 with the first value inside the viewport; status + presets on row 1, the three column/row controls
as one boxless line on row 2; header sentence without a count). The One-benchmark boards for the new E2 sources
(BullshitBench V1/V2, BU Bench) are plain and honest: category eyebrow, one description line, the notice
"independently measured results … not matched to a catalog model yet", ranked rows with a single accent bar.
The model page's new speed/context line ("Output 53 tokens/s · First token 9.8 s · Context 1M tokens" + one (i))
is one quiet line under the title — exactly the right weight. Simple, Guided, Benchmaxxing unchanged and at
the bar. The R3.1 hero stands.

Findings, ordered by value (all small; the page is right in substance):

1. **A single value in a row wore a full-width bar.** ECI 157.6 (Kimi K3 only), Software ECI 161.7, Coding Agent
   Index v1.4/v1.5 (one value each) — `rowBars` normalises over the row, so the only value is the row maximum and
   gets a 100 % band. It reads as "best of the row" where there is nothing to compare, and it is the loudest thing
   in the single-result block that F-81 pushed to the end of each group. → **F-84**, surgical (Fable, `ec80831`):
   fewer than two values → no bar, the same threshold `rowWinners` already uses.
2. **Two totals on the first line again.** The status line read "29 benchmarks across 9 categories in 31 rows ·
   top 5 by Composite under your filters": 29 ≠ 31 is a puzzle to a first-time visitor (two benchmarks are split
   into harness cohorts). The cohort is named on the rows themselves; the second total added nothing. → **F-85**,
   surgical (Fable, `ec80831`): the " in N rows" span is gone; `verify-cr-1` now asserts rows ≥ benchmarks.
3. **The "Better than a model" panel lets you choose a comparison that cannot work.** With the retained
   reference "Claude Opus 4.7 (…)" chosen, the "Benchmark or category" select still lists all 70 metrics; picking
   one without a value for that reference yields "This reference has no comparable result for that choice, so
   the filter is inactive." The user has to guess through 70 entries to find the handful that work. Five of the
   70 labels are also identical (the same benchmark name · category · unit for two registry versions), so two
   entries cannot be told apart. → **F-86** `[judgment → claude-opus]`, open below: options without a value for
   the chosen reference are disabled and say so; colliding labels carry the version.
4. **Transient, not a finding:** one context (desktop dark, `/`) logged a single `502` for a sub-resource; six
   re-loads (light/dark × 3) returned no 5xx. Recorded in `metrics.json`; nothing to fix.

Not findings, checked: at 390 the status line wraps with the count select at the start of line 2 ("… · top / [5]
by Composite under your filters") — acceptable, the select is the only control in that sentence; the Reference
model select lists 552 catalog variants on a phone — a native `<select>`, the platform picker handles it; the
Refine sheet's "Better than a model" block matches the desktop popover.

## Decisions in pass 16

1. **R3.1 stands.** No change.
2. **A data bar needs two values** (F-84) — rule added to the design-system notes. Bars stay row-normalised
   (Excel convention: the row's best is the full band); percentages are not re-based to 0–100 in the table
   because the chart already shows absolute scales.
3. **One total per line** (F-85): the status line counts benchmarks and categories; the rows chooser counts rows
   it offers; nothing counts table rows.
4. **F-86 goes to the work loop**, not to Fable: it touches the comparison data shape (which reference has which
   values) and the P2 follow-up already lists the duplicate labels and the empty-table case.
5. **CR-1.10 stays `verified`**; F-84/F-85 are refinements after the acceptance, live-checked by Fable
   (`after/`), and need a non-Fable verifier like every Fable-landed change. **X4 (UI meets the design bar):
   judged met at pass 16** for every page shot; the ledger row stays with its owner until X6.
6. **Next Fable pass:** none scheduled. Florian asked for Fable sparingly; the remaining open work (P2 governance,
   X6/X7) is not design work. A further pass only if a CR lands that changes a page's layout.

## R3.1 — Hero claim (decided in pass 1, re-decided in pass 8, confirmed passes 9–16)

> **Every AI model benchmark we can find, in one place.**
> **And what each model really costs you.**

Line 2 accent-coloured. The muted counts line underneath is generated from the dataset.
Rejected: Florian's draft ("All benchmark results for every model, in one place. The most
realistic cost estimate for each model.") — "all … every" over-reaches (P4); the pass-1 wording
("The most complete collection … the only place …") — "only" is not provable against Artificial
Analysis' cost per task (review gate 2026-09-13 20:50); the iteration-35 wording ("A complete,
source-linked collection … grounded in provider prices, caching, and token efficiency.") — a
methodology sentence, three lines, repeated in the footer. If Florian wants the superlative back,
the honest form is "The most complete collection of AI model benchmarks we know of."

## Directives (open)

> **Status 2026-09-15 pass 16 (Fable), end of pass:** **one directive open for implementers: F-86.** F-84 and F-85
> landed in `ec80831` and were live-checked by Fable (`fable-20260915-pass16/after/`); they need a **non-Fable
> verifier** to set `verified` (`node ops/ux-2026-09-12/bin/verify-cr-1.mjs <base> <out>` covers both: bars
> present, none on missing cells, status line without "in N rows", rows ≥ benchmarks).

### F-86 `[judgment → claude-opus]` "Better than a model": only offer comparisons the reference can answer
*Where:* `components/ModelExplorer.tsx` (`comparisonMetrics`, `comparisonPanel`), `lib/benchmark-comparison.mjs`
(labels), `test/benchmark-comparison.test.mjs` (or the nearest existing test file).
*What:*
1. **Disable what cannot work.** Once a reference model is chosen, every option in "Benchmark or category"
   whose `values[comparisonTarget]` is missing renders `disabled` with the suffix " · no result for this model";
   options with a bridged (approximate) value get the suffix " · bridged". The enabled options come first, in the
   existing order (category medians, then benchmarks); disabled ones follow. With no reference chosen the list is
   unchanged. If the currently selected metric becomes unavailable after a reference change, keep it selected
   (the existing "no comparable result" status line stays as the fallback) — do not silently clear it.
2. **No two options with the same label.** Where two axes share `name · category · unit`, append the registry
   version (`axis.version`, e.g. " · v1.4") to both; if the versions are equal too, append the cohort. Today 5 of
   70 labels collide. Unit test: `buildBenchmarkComparison` output has unique labels for a fixture with two
   versions of one benchmark.
3. **Reference list, cheap win:** the "Reference model" select keeps every catalog model (retained references
   like Opus 4.7 must stay choosable), but models with **no** value in any metric go last under a disabled
   separator option "— no comparable results —". No other change to that select.
4. Nothing else moves: the popover width, the Refine sheet block, the status sentence, "Clear comparison".
5. **Naming, while there:** the retained reference is labelled "Opus 4.7 (medium)" beside "Claude Opus 4.7 (Adaptive
   Reasoning, Max Effort)" — the harness-only catalog entry should carry the catalog convention ("Claude Opus 4.7
   (Adaptive Reasoning, Medium Effort)"), which is the P2 row's "duplicate harness-only catalog ids" follow-up; fix it
   there, not in the component.
*Accept (both hosts, 1440 popover and 390 Refine sheet, light/dark; `verify-p2-history.mjs` gains the assertions):*
after choosing the retained reference `claude-opus-4.7::medium` (today labelled "Opus 4.7 (medium)") the metric select has ≥ 1 enabled and ≥ 1
disabled option; every disabled option's text ends with "no result for this model"; the enabled option whose
label starts with "AA Coding Agent Index v1.5" (or the registry name) selects and the status line shows a value
with the bridge disclosure; all option labels are unique; `npm test` and `tsc` green; `verify-cr-1` 92/92 per
host unchanged.

### F-84 `[surgical, Fable — landed ec80831]` No data bar on a single-value row
*Where:* `lib/benchmark-matrix.mjs` (`rowBars`: `present.length < 2` → all `null`), `test/benchmark-matrix.test.mjs`.
*Accept:* on `/benchmarks` (All preset, top 5) every row with exactly one value shows the number without a
`.bh-matrix-bar`; rows with ≥ 2 values keep their bars; `verify-cr-1` CR-1.5 check (bars > 0, none on missing
cells, alpha ≤ .25) still passes at 1440/390, light/dark, both hosts.

### F-85 `[surgical, Fable — landed ec80831]` Status line without the second total
*Where:* `components/BenchmarkMatrix.tsx` (status `<p role="status">`), `ops/ux-2026-09-12/bin/verify-cr-1.mjs`.
*Accept:* the status line matches `/^\d+ benchmarks across \d+ categories · /` and contains no "rows"; the
rendered table has ≥ as many rows as the benchmark count; the rows chooser still reads "(N of N)" with N equal
to the status line's benchmark count; F-83's four assertions unchanged.

## Design system notes (apply while touching any file above)

- **Type:** display serif (`--brand-serif`) only for the H1 on `/` and page titles; everything
  else the system sans. No serif in cards.
- **Colour:** accent blue for interactive and for magnitude bars; categorical colours only
  for organisation dots and Benchmaxxing topic sectors; green reserved for "passes / cheaper /
  Pareto", orange reserved for the Benchmaxxing tag. Never tint a table bar by organisation.
- **Density:** one explanatory sentence per block, at most; everything else is an (i) or a
  disclosure. Numbers in tables are `tabular-nums` and right-aligned.
- **Charts** follow the dataviz rules: data-driven axis domains with *round* ticks, labels on
  the marks when ≤ 12 marks and never overlapping, muted gridlines, the same palette in light
  and dark.
- **Mobile:** no element wider than 390 px; tables drop columns (F-14 order) before they
  scroll; charts are ≥ 200 px tall or not rendered; **no chart requires horizontal panning** —
  re-lay it out to fit 358 px or replace it with HTML bar rows (pass 9).
- **Controls:** icon-only buttons are 40×40 with `aria-label` and `title`; popovers, not
  inline `<details>` boxes, for secondary filters.
- **Names never truncate below `md`** (F-14, F-56, F-68, F-69): identifying text wraps; an ellipsis is
  acceptable only for secondary text. On charts, a ranked point's label is dropped only after all
  eight slots fail (F-67), and every SVG point label carries a 3 px `paint-order: stroke` halo in
  `var(--surface)` (F-70) so lines pass under names, never through them.
- **Quantities spanning > ~20× are never linear bars** (F-72): use a log-position mark (dot on a
  track) with round money ticks, as the value map does.
- **A cap never decides by the display order** (F-74): when a ranked list is truncated, the kept set is
  chosen by value (Pareto line first, then score) and the visible order is applied afterwards.
- **A data bar is a band, not a fill** (F-79): behind the number, fixed height (22 px), never the row height.
- **Comparison tables: comparable rows first** (F-81): inside a group, rows with two or more values among the
  compared columns precede single-value rows; the "show everything" default stays.
- **A data bar needs two values** (F-84): a row with a single result shows the number only; a lone band is
  "best of one" and misleads.
- **One total per line** (F-85): a status line counts one thing; secondary totals (rows, cohorts) live where the
  thing itself is shown.
- **The content starts within the first screen** (F-83): on a phone the first data cell of a page's main table
  is inside the 844 px viewport; controls collapse into two rows before they push it out.

## Earlier verdicts (condensed, for the record)

- **Pass 15 (2026-09-15 00:30 UTC, live `15d1a78`), the CR-1.10 pass on the Benchmarks page:** right in substance,
  not yet excellent — the table started too far down and the bars were blocks. Fixed F-79 (22 px band, phone stub
  without description), F-80 ("AA " prefix), F-81 (comparable rows first), F-82 (collapsed names in the Simple
  section), Fable `313e24c`, verified by claude-opus (iteration 61, `4dbd631`); opened F-83 (status + presets on
  row 1, boxless controls on row 2, header sentence without a count), landed by claude-opus `5f8dd9e`/`962cc48`/
  `c650bdd`, verified by gate 012002Z (opencode-kimi). Decisions: "All" stays the default row preset; the phone stub
  carries name, tags and cohort only; CR-1.10 verified once F-83 was checked. Rules added: a data bar is a band;
  comparable rows first; content starts within the first screen.
- **Pass 14 (2026-09-14 14:00 UTC, live `42da12c`):** at the bar on every page, both widths and themes; fixed F-74
  (shortlist cap keeps the Pareto line, then score), F-75 (Guided actions wrap between buttons), F-76 (no zero-peer
  option text), Fable `e33635b`; verified F-72/F-73 (claude-opus). Rule added: a cap never decides by the display
  order. Decisions: R3.1 and R5.2 unchanged; X4 judged met pending independent verification.
- **Pass 13 (2026-09-14 12:30 UTC, live `bf5b821`):** at the bar at 1440 and, after the pass, at 390; fixed F-69
  phone benchmark-sheet names wrap, F-70 value-map label halo, F-71 integer token counts (Fable, `f23f5f9`; verified
  by claude-opus gate 130002Z); opened F-72 (log-position dot plot, landed by claude-opus `26a709c`) and F-73
  (landed by claude-opus `4dffc1d`). Rules added: label halo; quantities spanning > ~20× are never linear bars.
- **Pass 12 (2026-09-14 11:20 UTC, live `975334b`):** at the bar on every page, both widths and themes; fixed F-67
  (eight label slots + headroom so the frontier's top point keeps its name on phones) and F-68 (Benchmaxxing names
  wrap at 390), Fable surgical `5e974fe`, verified by claude-opus (iteration 49). Rule added: names never truncate
  below `md`. Decisions: R3.1 and R5.2 unchanged.
- **Pass 11 (2026-09-14 09:10 UTC, live `4f8b690`):** core pages at the bar; the E2 boards opened on "No results"
  → F-65 automatic widening with one notice line and F-66 error-boundary Details (Fable, `72da684`; Kimi delegation
  produced no diff), live 168/168 per host. Rule: screenshot runs start ≥ 3 min after the revision flips.
- **Pass 10 (2026-09-14 06:25 UTC, live `4b0d250`):** at the bar at both widths and themes; fixed F-63 light-mode
  Charts tracks and F-64 Composite coverage wording (Fable surgical, `21aa63f`); both verified by claude-opus
  (iteration 47). Decisions: R3.1 and R5.2 unchanged; X4 judged met pending independent verification.
- **Pass 9 (2026-09-14 03:40 UTC, live `4374f29`):** desktop at the bar; opened F-58 phone Compare radar, F-59
  phone Charts bar rows, F-62 desktop radar 640 px (Kimi K3 draft + Fable, `7b5320d`); fixed F-60 Composite-first
  phone model page and F-61 doubled version tokens (Fable, `9240da5`/`97e50a4`). New rule: no chart may require
  horizontal panning below `md`. Decisions: R3.1 and R5.2 unchanged; R5.3 default 86 documented.
- **Pass 8 (2026-09-14 01:30 UTC, live `54872fc`):** re-decided the hero (F-53, Fable surgical); opened
  F-54 version labels, F-55 one (i) style, F-56 phone name wrapping, F-57 phone title — all landed in
  `84cdff7` and verified by claude-opus / codex-luna. Decisions: R5.2 literal, cost-inputs modal stays dense.
- **Pass 7 (2026-09-13 20:10 UTC, live `dea90cb`):** verified F-43, F-44, F-48 (Codex); fixed F-49 cost
  precision and F-52 Compare head; opened F-50, F-51. Decisions: R5.2 literal, R3.1 pass-1 wording stood
  (superseded in pass 8 after the 20:50 review gate), F-22 map = pool.
- **Pass 6 (17:30 UTC, live `2cf4080`):** verified F-42, F-45 (Codex); fixed F-46 phone (i) overflow
  and F-47 error boundary; opened F-48. Decisions: R3.1 line 2 final (fallback recorded for X7),
  R5.3 floor 85 applied as ≥ 85, F-22 map = pool with ranked rows full-opacity.
- **Pass 5 (15:30 UTC, live `3d7af32`):** verified F-31 … F-38 (Codex); fixed F-39 (log axis, 46/138
  overlapping ticks → 0); opened F-40 slider leak, F-41 hatch rule, F-42 phone captions, F-43 radar,
  F-44 Compare, F-45 small cuts. Decisions: log axis with pinned free routes stays (R5.10); hatch
  counts exact + attached; F-38 label superseded by R5.7.
- **Pass 4 (live `0a1…`):** fixed F-29 dark-map labels and F-30 Guided→Simple leak; opened F-31 … F-38.
  Decisions: hero line 2 kept with fallback for X7; R5.2 cost-descending Simple kept; "est." moved
  from cells to header.
- **Pass 3:** model page as release post (F-08b), phone Advanced Refine sheet (F-23), Benchmaxxing
  table density (F-24), thin-evidence hatch (F-25), Benchmarks page (F-27), slider histograms (F-28).
- **Passes 1–2:** hero claim R3.1, compact hero F-01, one-row nav F-02, Simple value map F-03,
  ranking bars F-05, many-axis radar F-07, Charts F-09, wizard polish F-10, footer F-12, one
  shortlist card F-13, phone table F-14, header F-15, full-catalog Advanced F-16, collision-free
  map labels F-17, Filters overlay F-18.
- **Independent verification (claude-opus, iteration 14, live `0e7380c`):** F-02, F-03, F-05 verified;
  F-12 fixed there; F-01 → F-13, F-06 → F-16. Evidence `ux-evidence/iter14-indep-review/`.
