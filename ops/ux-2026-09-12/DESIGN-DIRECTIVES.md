# DESIGN DIRECTIVES — Benchmark Heaven (design authority: Claude Fable 5.1)

**Pass 13: 2026-09-14 ~12:30 UTC**, against live revision `bf5b821` (https://benchmarkheaven.com).
Evidence: `/opt/benchmarkheaven/state/ux-evidence/fable-20260914-pass13/` — 80-shot base matrix
(`metrics.json`: `errors` empty in all four contexts, no overflow at 390 on any page) plus a supplemental
run (`SUPP=1`, `metrics-supp.json`): the Filters overlay at both widths, the Guided results step, and the
five E2 boards (Vals, ApprenticeBench, FrontierCode, CursorBench, Real-SWE). Script:
`bin/shoot-fable-pass13.mjs`. Pass-13 fixes: `verify-f69-f71/` (`bin/verify-f69-f71.mjs`).
Earlier passes: `…/fable-20260914-pass12/` … `…/fable-20260913/`.

**The bar (Florian):** minimalistic and simple, very expressive, not overloaded, key messages
first, graphical with many charts.

**How to use this file.** Directives are numbered `F-nn`, ordered by value. Each has *Where*
(files), *What* (implementable spec), *Accept* (what the reviewer checks live). Implementers
take the top open directive, ship it, move its row to the *Done log* at the bottom with the
commit hash and evidence path. Do not re-interpret a directive; if it cannot be done as
written, leave it open and write why under it. Fable decides, others implement.

**Delegation hint.** `[mechanical]` directives are safe for `bin/delegate.sh --kimi` (clear
spec, no numbers to invent) with a 20-minute cap; `[judgment]` ones need Claude Opus 5 or Codex
Luna. Every delegated diff is reviewed before it lands. Record from passes 8, 11, 12 and iterations
17/50: Kimi K3 stalls on one-file TSX edits (reads, no diff); surgical TSX changes are faster done by
the reviewing engine directly.

## Verdict on the live site — pass 13 (2026-09-14)

**At the bar on every page at 1440, and at 390 with one exception: the phone model page.** The base
matrix repeats pass 12's picture — Simple opens on the two-line claim, the counts line, two sliders
with histograms, the value map with the Pareto line and seven ranked rows; Advanced is one toolbar row
and the full catalog with coverage pips; Guided asks one question per step and lands on a results
view that names the answers as chips; Benchmaxxing leads with the ten strongest signals and the
many-axis radar; Compare, Benchmarks and Charts read as in pass 12; dark mode is the same design in
other colours everywhere. The three views the pass-12 script had silently skipped were shot this time
(see "script" below) and are fine: the Filters overlay is four labelled groups and a "More settings"
disclosure at both widths; the Guided results step shows answers → sliders → map → table; the E2 boards
open with rows and one notice line each.

Findings, ordered by value:

1. **Phone model page truncates benchmark names** (`mobile_light-model-full.png`, crop
   `checks/crop-model-sheet.png`): "Terminal-Be…" twice (v2.1 and v4.0 — indistinguishable), "SciCode (A…",
   "AA Coding In…", "DesignArena …" twice, "Humanity's …". Breaks the pass-12 rule "identifying text never
   truncates below `md`". → **F-69**, surgical (Fable, landed `f23f5f9`).
2. **The Pareto line runs through the two top labels on the phone value map** ("Claude Fable 5.1", "GPT-6
   Astra", `mobile_light-simple.png`). F-67 found the slot; the line still crosses the glyphs. → **F-70**, a
   text halo, surgical (Fable, landed `f23f5f9`).
3. **The cost-inputs modal shows fractional tokens** — "Input tokens/task (derived) 6,938,474.87",
   "88.829:1", "87.39 %" (`desktop_light-advanced-row-expanded.png`). Tokens are counts. → **F-71**,
   surgical (Fable, landed `f23f5f9`).
4. **Charts · "Cheapest models" is a linear bar chart over a 120× range**: 13 of 16 bars are slivers of
   ≤ 8 px, the cheap end — the point of the card — is unreadable, while the value map beside it uses a
   log axis (`desktop_light-charts-full.png`, `mobile_light-charts-full.png`). → **F-72**, open,
   `[judgment]` for the next work iteration (spec below).
5. **E2 boards repeat "not matched to a catalog model" under every row** although the notice line above
   the table already says none is matched (`desktop_light-benchmarks-vals.png`,
   `desktop_dark-benchmarks-frontiercode.png`). → **F-73**, open, `[mechanical]`, low.

Not findings, checked: the visible "Skip to main content" box in `mobile_light-guided-5-full.png` is a
full-page-capture artifact — after the wizard the skip link's computed transform is still
`translateY(-93.6px)`, `document.activeElement` is `body`, and the viewport shot shows nothing
(`checks/skipcheck2.mjs` in the evidence folder). Guided step 4 prints "$0.360" — three
significant digits, the F-49 rule; consistent with "$0.955", stays.

**Script (not a design finding, but it changes what earlier passes could claim):** the committed
`shoot-fable-pass12.mjs` had a same-line comment that swallowed `const opts`, so its E2-board block threw
`opts is not defined` in every context; the Filters button was looked up as `/^Filters/` while its
accessible name is "Open filters and settings"; and the wizard loop stopped before the results step
because the last button reads "See the models →". Pass 12's evidence folder does contain board shots, so
that run used an uncommitted edit; from pass 13 on the committed script is the one that produced the
evidence. Rule: `metrics.json` must show no `*-err` keys before a pass claims a page was shot.

Not opened, on purpose (re-judged with fresh eyes, same conclusions as passes 8–12):

- **Score bars run 0–100** in the tables and the Charts leaderboard although the visible range is
  78.8–99.4. A bar encodes length; a truncated baseline would make a 3-point gap look like a doubling.
  The value map, the Pareto line and the numbers carry the differences. Stays.
- **Simple lists the priciest model first** (R5.2, literal) — the standing question for Florian.
- The **cost-inputs modal stays dense** (pass-8 decision: it is the audit trail behind one number);
  F-71 only fixes the number formats.
- The **model page leads with the provider table on the left and the Composite on the right** at 1440
  (F-08b); on phones the Composite comes first (F-60). Both key messages are in the first screen. Stays.
- "7 models pass **of 16** · 9 below your score line · **show all 16**" carries two links to the same
  place. Harmless redundancy; stays until the next copy pass.

## Decisions in pass 13

1. **R3.1 stands** (pass-8 wording; verified by three engines and the P4 gate). No change.
2. **R5.2 stays literal** (cost-descending Simple); the question stays in the X7 Telegram list.
3. **F-69 layout rule:** below `md`, a benchmark-sheet row is two lines — the name (wrapping) on the
   first, bar · percentile · value on the second. At `md` and above the four-column single line stays.
   Rejected: a smaller font (10 px names on a phone) and abbreviating benchmark names (the version
   suffix *is* the identifying part).
4. **F-70 halo rule:** every SVG point label gets `paint-order: stroke` with a 3 px stroke in the card
   surface colour (`var(--surface)`), so a line may pass under a label but never through its glyphs.
   Added to the design-system notes.
5. **F-72 form rule:** a quantity that spans more than ~20× is not drawn as a linear bar. Use a log
   position mark (dot on a track) with round money ticks, as the value map already does.
6. **X4:** in the design authority's judgment the live UI meets Florian's bar at 1440 and 390, light
   and dark, once F-69–F-71 are live (checked below); F-72 is an improvement to one Charts card, not a
   bar failure. What remains for X4 is procedural (non-Fable verification of F-66, F-69, F-70, F-71)
   plus F-72.
7. **Next design pass** only after a UI-touching iteration (F-72 or E2 UI). Matrix script:
   `bin/shoot-fable-pass13.mjs` (base) + `SUPP=1` (extras).

## R3.1 — Hero claim (decided in pass 1, re-decided in pass 8, confirmed passes 9–13)

> **Every AI model benchmark we can find, in one place.**
> **And what each model really costs you.**

Line 2 accent-coloured. The muted counts line underneath is generated from the dataset.
Rejected: Florian's draft ("All benchmark results for every model, in one place. The most
realistic cost estimate for each model.") — "all … every" over-reaches (P4); the pass-1 wording
("The most complete collection … the only place …") — "only" is not provable against Artificial
Analysis' cost per task (review gate 2026-09-13 20:50); the iteration-35 wording ("A complete,
source-linked collection … grounded in provider prices, caching, and token efficiency.") — a
methodology sentence, three lines, repeated in the footer. If Florian wants the superlative back,
the honest form is "The most complete collection of AI model benchmarks we know of."

## Directives (open)

> **Status 2026-09-14 pass 13 (Fable), end of pass:** **F-72** and **F-73** open for implementers
> (F-72 first). F-69, F-70, F-71 landed in `f23f5f9` and were live-checked by Fable
> (`verify-f69-f71/verification.json`); they need a **non-Fable verifier** to set `verified`, as do
> F-65/F-66 from pass 11 (F-65 verified by claude-opus in iteration 49; F-66 still needs a forced client
> error in a dev build).

### F-72 `[judgment]` Charts · "Cheapest models" as a log-position dot plot
*Where:* `components/ChartsBoard.tsx` — the `Cheapest models` `<Panel>` (desktop `BarChart`, phone
`MobileBars`); `DotStrip` in the same file already has the log positioning (`pos()` with `log`).
*What:* replace the length encoding with a position encoding on a log axis, at both widths.
- Desktop: one row per model (26 px), sorted ascending as today; a muted track (`rgb(var(--line)/.5)`)
  across the plot width, a 7 px accent dot at the log position, the value label to the right of the dot
  (`priceNumber`), the org dot + short name in the 205 px left column as today. X axis: log, domain from
  the cheapest to the priciest value padded to round money ticks — the same tick set the value map uses
  (`$0.1 $0.3 $1 $3 $10 $30`, only those inside the domain), muted vertical gridlines at the ticks, an
  "Adjusted cost · log scale" caption bottom-right (as on the Score-vs-cost card). Implement with recharts
  `ScatterChart` (`XAxis scale="log"`, `YAxis type="category"`) or a small SVG — either is fine; no bar,
  no `Bar` component, no fill from zero.
- Phone (`MobileBars` with a `log` prop): keep the name + value line; the second line becomes a track
  with a dot at the log position instead of a filled bar. Free/zero values: pin at the left edge, as the
  value map does (F-39).
- Tooltip and the keyboard-accessible table below the card stay as they are.
*Accept (`bin/verify-f72.mjs`, both hosts, 1440/390, light/dark):* on `/charts` the card contains no
`.recharts-bar-rectangle` and no phone fill bar; at 1440 the marks of the three cheapest rows differ in
x by ≥ 10 px pairwise (0.198 → 0.388 → 0.867 are ≥ 1.9× apart); every x tick label is one of
`$0.1 $0.3 $1 $3 $10 $30 $100`; the caption says "log scale"; no overflow at 390; `metrics` `errors`
empty.

### F-73 `[mechanical]` E2 boards: say "not matched" once
*Where:* `components/BenchmarkRanking.tsx` (row sub-line, line ~89: `'As named by the source · not
matched to a catalog model'`).
*What:* when *every* visible row is unmatched (the notice line above the table already says "none is
matched to a catalog model yet"), the row sub-line is just "As named by the source" (+ harness/variant as
today). On mixed boards (some rows matched) keep the full per-row text so the two kinds stay
distinguishable.
*Accept:* on `/benchmarks?benchmark=vals-index-code-migration::2` and `…=frontiercode::1.1` the string
"not matched to a catalog model" appears exactly once (the notice line); on a mixed board it still
appears under each unmatched row; no other text changes.

### F-69 `[surgical, Fable — landed f23f5f9]` Phone benchmark sheet: names wrap
*Where:* `components/BenchmarkSheet.tsx` (row `<summary>` grid; name span `col-span-2 md:col-span-1
md:truncate`).
*Accept (`bin/verify-f69-f71.mjs`, both hosts):* on `/models/claude-opus-5::high` at 390 no name span has
`scrollWidth > clientWidth`, rows are two lines (≥ 40 px), no horizontal overflow; at 1440 rows stay one
line (≤ 36 px).

### F-70 `[surgical, Fable — landed f23f5f9]` Value-map label halo
*Where:* `components/CostCapabilityScatter.tsx` (`PointLabels` `<text>`: `paintOrder="stroke"
stroke="var(--surface)" strokeWidth={3} strokeLinejoin="round"`).
*Accept (same script):* every `.bh-point-labels text` on `/` has `paint-order: stroke` and a non-`none`
computed stroke, at both widths and themes.

### F-71 `[surgical, Fable — landed f23f5f9]` Cost-inputs modal: counts are integers
*Where:* `components/PriceValue.tsx` (`<dl>`: tokens `Math.round(…).toLocaleString`, ratio `toFixed(1)`,
hit rate `toFixed(1)`).
*Accept (same script):* opening the first price in the Simple table shows integer input and output token
counts, a ratio like `88.8:1`, a hit rate like `87.4%`.

### F-66 `[verify only]` Error boundary Details — acceptance
A forced client error renders the branded panel with a "Details" disclosure whose body is
`error.name: error.message` (non-empty); `metrics.json` of every pass since 11 has an `errors` key
(pass 12 and 13: present and empty).

## Design system notes (apply while touching any file above)

- **Type:** display serif (`--brand-serif`) only for the H1 on `/` and page titles; everything
  else the system sans. No serif in cards.
- **Colour:** accent blue for interactive and for magnitude bars; categorical colours only
  for organisation dots and Benchmaxxing topic sectors; green reserved for "passes / cheaper /
  Pareto", orange reserved for the Benchmaxxing tag. Never tint a table bar by organisation.
- **Density:** one explanatory sentence per block, at most; everything else is an (i) or a
  disclosure. Numbers in tables are `tabular-nums` and right-aligned.
- **Charts** follow the dataviz rules: data-driven axis domains with *round* ticks, labels on
  the marks when ≤ 12 marks and never overlapping, muted gridlines, the same palette in light
  and dark.
- **Mobile:** no element wider than 390 px; tables drop columns (F-14 order) before they
  scroll; charts are ≥ 200 px tall or not rendered; **no chart requires horizontal panning** —
  re-lay it out to fit 358 px or replace it with HTML bar rows (pass 9).
- **Controls:** icon-only buttons are 40×40 with `aria-label` and `title`; popovers, not
  inline `<details>` boxes, for secondary filters.
- **Names never truncate below `md`** (F-14, F-56, F-68, F-69): identifying text wraps; an ellipsis is
  acceptable only for secondary text. On charts, a ranked point's label is dropped only after all
  eight slots fail (F-67), and every SVG point label carries a 3 px `paint-order: stroke` halo in
  `var(--surface)` (F-70) so lines pass under names, never through them.
- **Quantities spanning > ~20× are never linear bars** (F-72): use a log-position mark (dot on a
  track) with round money ticks, as the value map does.

## Earlier verdicts (condensed, for the record)

- **Pass 12 (2026-09-14 11:20 UTC, live `975334b`):** at the bar on every page, both widths and themes; fixed F-67
  (eight label slots + headroom so the frontier's top point keeps its name on phones) and F-68 (Benchmaxxing names
  wrap at 390), Fable surgical `5e974fe`, verified by claude-opus (iteration 49). Rule added: names never truncate
  below `md`. Decisions: R3.1 and R5.2 unchanged.
- **Pass 11 (2026-09-14 09:10 UTC, live `4f8b690`):** core pages at the bar; the E2 boards opened on "No results"
  → F-65 automatic widening with one notice line and F-66 error-boundary Details (Fable, `72da684`; Kimi delegation
  produced no diff), live 168/168 per host. Rule: screenshot runs start ≥ 3 min after the revision flips.
- **Pass 10 (2026-09-14 06:25 UTC, live `4b0d250`):** at the bar at both widths and themes; fixed F-63 light-mode
  Charts tracks and F-64 Composite coverage wording (Fable surgical, `21aa63f`); both verified by claude-opus
  (iteration 47). Decisions: R3.1 and R5.2 unchanged; X4 judged met pending independent verification.
- **Pass 9 (2026-09-14 03:40 UTC, live `4374f29`):** desktop at the bar; opened F-58 phone Compare radar, F-59
  phone Charts bar rows, F-62 desktop radar 640 px (Kimi K3 draft + Fable, `7b5320d`); fixed F-60 Composite-first
  phone model page and F-61 doubled version tokens (Fable, `9240da5`/`97e50a4`). New rule: no chart may require
  horizontal panning below `md`. Decisions: R3.1 and R5.2 unchanged; R5.3 default 86 documented.
- **Pass 8 (2026-09-14 01:30 UTC, live `54872fc`):** re-decided the hero (F-53, Fable surgical); opened
  F-54 version labels, F-55 one (i) style, F-56 phone name wrapping, F-57 phone title — all landed in
  `84cdff7` and verified by claude-opus / codex-luna. Decisions: R5.2 literal, cost-inputs modal stays dense.
- **Pass 7 (2026-09-13 20:10 UTC, live `dea90cb`):** verified F-43, F-44, F-48 (Codex); fixed F-49 cost
  precision and F-52 Compare head; opened F-50, F-51. Decisions: R5.2 literal, R3.1 pass-1 wording stood
  (superseded in pass 8 after the 20:50 review gate), F-22 map = pool.
- **Pass 6 (17:30 UTC, live `2cf4080`):** verified F-42, F-45 (Codex); fixed F-46 phone (i) overflow
  and F-47 error boundary; opened F-48. Decisions: R3.1 line 2 final (fallback recorded for X7),
  R5.3 floor 85 applied as ≥ 85, F-22 map = pool with ranked rows full-opacity.
- **Pass 5 (15:30 UTC, live `3d7af32`):** verified F-31 … F-38 (Codex); fixed F-39 (log axis, 46/138
  overlapping ticks → 0); opened F-40 slider leak, F-41 hatch rule, F-42 phone captions, F-43 radar,
  F-44 Compare, F-45 small cuts. Decisions: log axis with pinned free routes stays (R5.10); hatch
  counts exact + attached; F-38 label superseded by R5.7.
- **Pass 4 (live `0a1…`):** fixed F-29 dark-map labels and F-30 Guided→Simple leak; opened F-31 … F-38.
  Decisions: hero line 2 kept with fallback for X7; R5.2 cost-descending Simple kept; "est." moved
  from cells to header.
- **Pass 3:** model page as release post (F-08b), phone Advanced Refine sheet (F-23), Benchmaxxing
  table density (F-24), thin-evidence hatch (F-25), Benchmarks page (F-27), slider histograms (F-28).
- **Passes 1–2:** hero claim R3.1, compact hero F-01, one-row nav F-02, Simple value map F-03,
  ranking bars F-05, many-axis radar F-07, Charts F-09, wizard polish F-10, footer F-12, one
  shortlist card F-13, phone table F-14, header F-15, full-catalog Advanced F-16, collision-free
  map labels F-17, Filters overlay F-18.
- **Independent verification (claude-opus, iteration 14, live `0e7380c`):** F-02, F-03, F-05 verified;
  F-12 fixed there; F-01 → F-13, F-06 → F-16. Evidence `ux-evidence/iter14-indep-review/`.
